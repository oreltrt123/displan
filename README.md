We’re committed to delivering frequent enhancements—sometimes daily—ensuring that DisPlan remains equipped with the most advanced, relevant, and user-friendly tools available.

This also takes me to the next level.

At DisPlan, our platform is built on a foundation of powerful, modern, and innovative technologies—carefully selected to make your experience as seamless and effective as possible.

Our backend is powered by Supabase, an open-source alternative to Firebase that provides scalable and secure database management, real-time updates, and authentication—ensuring your data is handled reliably and efficiently.

For deployment, we use Vercel, one of the leading platforms for frontend hosting. Vercel allows us to ship updates quickly and ensures fast, globally distributed performance—so your experience is always responsive and smooth, no matter where you are in the world.

Payments on our platform are powered by Stripe, a secure and widely trusted solution for managing subscriptions, transactions, and financial integrations. Whether you're selling a service or accessing premium tools, Stripe guarantees a frictionless checkout experience.

One of the unique aspects of DisPlan is our commitment to accessibility—the majority of our tools, including our AI assistant, are completely free to use. Our AI, or "EI" (Enhanced Intelligence), will remain free even as new premium features roll out in future updates.

We also provide seamless integration with major media libraries so that you have access to the high-quality content you need. For example, we use Unsplash to offer a vast collection of royalty-free images directly within your projects. In addition, we recommend Pexels as a second integrated source, allowing you to access an even wider variety of free videos and high-resolution photography—ideal for web design, marketing, and creative development.

Finally, our platform is developed using the advanced TypeScript programming language, which allows us to write more robust, scalable, and secure code. TypeScript’s static typing, modern tooling, and developer-friendly features ensure that we can build high-quality applications that grow with your needs.

DisPlan is not just a platform—it’s a powerful ecosystem designed to bring your ideas to life and take you to the next level.
